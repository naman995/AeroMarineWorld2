                Aeromarineworld has provided custom wheels fabrication for ground use of heavy machinery using retreaded
                aircraft tires.
                Flaps, Tubes and tires from non-flyable aircraft tires can provide an technologically advanced and yet
                economical way to
                cater to tough ground use. <br> <br>
                We have also helped plan the supply chain and logistics for carbon cleaning machines used in diesel
                engines and
                generators servicing. These advanced machinery are used to improve the efficiency and remove carbon
                deposits to increase
                the life and serviceability of large diesel engines.
