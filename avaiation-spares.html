                The Bombardier Challenger 300 is a super-mid-sized jet capable of traversing transcontinental distances.
                It is different
                from a similarly named Challenger 600 series but spares parts cross-over is very common. The Challenger
                300 has a large
                cabin and is high-performing. It falls into the “super-midsize” private jet class. It can fly eight
                passengers
                coast-to-coast nonstop, and was designed to have low direct operating costs.
